    "Esters are amongst the most important flavour compounds in alcoholic beverages (Quilter et al., 2023). They are formed as byproducts in the reaction of esterification of alcohols with acetyl coenzyme A (see Figure 1) (Yoshimoto and Bogaki, 2023). One of the principal esters produced during alcohol fermentation is isoamyl acetate which gives a banana-like flavour (Furukawa, 2012). Isoamyl acetate is produced from a reaction between amyl alcohol and acetyl coenzyme A catalyzed by the enzyme isoamyl alcohol acetyl transferase (Yoshimoto and Bogaki, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications of the product\n",
    "\n",
    "Isoamyl acetate is a flavoring and fragrance additive in various products because of its fruity banana flavor and aroma (Lopes et al., 2017). It is used as an additive to food like different candies which try to emulate the sweet taste of bananas (Mordor Intelligence, 01.12.2013). It is added to several alcoholic beverages as a way to add complexity to wines (Lopes et al., 2017). Even the pharmaceutical industry uses isoamyl acetate as an additive to make chewing tablets more attractive and easier for children to eat (Mordor Intelligence, 01.12.2013). Another application of isoamyl acetate include cosmetics and personal care industry as an odor additive to products like perfume and body creams (Torres, et al., 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Market potential \n",
    "\n",
    "From market observations done in the period between 2018 and 2023, the CAGR of isoamyl acetate was estimated to be above 3% (Mordor Intelligence, 01.12.2013). This means there's a growing and healthy global demand for this compound in multiple industries. The main growing market for this compound has been the Asian-Pacific market where personal care interest has skyrocketed in the last few years. The Asian-Pacific market's global share has been estimated to be 45% of all isoamyl acetate traded. The main countries with growing industries needing isoamyl acetate are China, Japan, India, and South Korea (Mordor Intelligence, 01.12.2013). \n",
    "\n",
    "A future market can also be estimated to exist in countries like Vietnam. This is because of its growing population and cheap labor which is, for some, a more enticing alternative to China. This pivot of production and labor away from China is because of recent hostilities with China and the risks totalitarian regimes like China can have to business (Mai and Phuong, 2020).\n"

    "Fermentation, typically conducted under mild conditions, is energy-efficient and has a lesser environmental footprint than conventional chemical processes (Nielsen and Jegannathan, 2013). Therefore microbial biosynthesis of isoamyl acetate is preferred for its sustainability, utilizing cell factories capable of converting various substrates, such as agro-industrial by-products, into high-value products (Zhang et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over millennia, yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) has functioned as a cellular manufacturing hub for the synthesis of staple commodities such as bread, beer, and wine. In more recent times, S. cerevisiae has transcended its traditional applications, assuming the role of a versatile cell factory for the production of diverse fuels, chemicals, food constituents, and pharmaceuticals (Nielsen, 2019). Moreover, S. cerevisiae stands as a pivotal model organism in elucidating eukaryotic biology. Presently, myriad advancements crucial to the understanding and treatment of human diseases continue to emerge through investigations utilizing S. cerevisiae as a model organism (Nielsen, 2019).\n",

    "Product-related issues include low production rates, which limit industrial scalability and economic feasibility (Yuan, 2016). Additionally, the concentrations of isoamyl acetate achieved in fermentation broths are often suboptimal, necessitating costly downstream processing to reach commercially viable levels (Mansor, 2020). Another concern is the low yield of isoamyl acetate relative to the glucose consumed, which reflects inefficiencies in the metabolic pathway of S. cerevisiae (Yuan, 2016).\n",

By optimizing the metabolic pathways and fermentation processes, we intend to develop a more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable production method for high-quality isoamyl acetate. \n"

    "Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) represent extensive knowledgebases that provide a platform for model simulations and integrative analysis of omics data. Our choice of host organism, S. cerevisiae, is a very common and well-researched organism, thus multiple genome-scale metabolic models (GSMs) exist.

The subsequent model, iND750, distinguishes itself with full compartmentalization and includes 750 genes and their associated transcripts, proteins, and reactions (Duarte et al., 2004). Its validation came from extensive gene deletion studies and analysis of metabolic phenotypes  (Duarte et al., 2004), and it further incorporates regulatory elements to predict gene expression and outcomes in various transcription factor mutants (Herrgard et al., 2006).  The third model, iLL672, is an evolution of iFF708; addresses and removes several dead-end reactions found in iFF708, thereby refining the accuracy of predictions for single gene deletions (Kuepfer et al., 2005). The iMM904 metabolic network was reconstructed based on iND750 to investigate how changes in the extracellular metabolome can be used to study systemic changes in intracellular metabolic states (Mo et al., 2009). It has shown consistency in the predicted intracellular flux changes with published measurements on intracellular metabolite levels and fluxes (Mo et al., 2009).

Meanwhile, the isoamyl acetate formation rate begins to plateau at 450 and reaches its top point at 632 mmol/gDW/h, but it slowly decreases in efficiency afterward. Therefore, it can be concluded that the glucose uptake rate should be optimized for biomass since it has a minimal effect on product formation. \n",

    "\n",
    "The experimental process outlined in this study reveals potential solutions for boosting isoamyl acetate production in S. cerevisiae. So far, the most significant impact on yield has been achieved through simple medium recomposition; however, this solution may not be the most cost-effective in the long run. While higher glucose and leucine concentrations theoretically lead to increased biomass growth and product yield, practical constraints such as cost and potential inhibitory effects must be considered. Selecting optimal glucose and leucine concentrations becomes a decision influenced by both biological and economic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, cofactor swapping showed a ~1.2-fold increase in our compound production. Additionally, gene regulation targets suggest promising ways to increase substrate availability for isoamyl acetate production, with some proposed solutions related to existing literature (Vadali et al., 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenotype phase plane analysis yielded interesting results. Biomass production was higher in the presence of oxygen, aligning with expectations. However, isoamyl acetate production also peaked at similar oxygen levels, contrary to literature data. Alcohol acetyltransferases, which catalyze reactions between alcohol and acetyl-CoA coenzyme, were shown to be repressed when yeasts are cultured under aerobic conditions (Torres, 2010). Thus, higher yields would be expected at lower oxygen levels. Nevertheless, DFBA was decided to be run in aerobic conditions, providing valuable predictive insights into the fermentation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations in this project addressed isoamyl acetate yield and production rate, as well as host growth rates. The next steps for designing a functional cell factory would involve elucidating up- and downregulation targets and studying their influence on biomass and product yields. Moreover, fermentation experiments should be conducted with different media compositions, varying levels of glucose, leucine, and potentially pyruvate, all precursors in the isoamyl acetate pathway (Yoshimoto and Bogaki, 2023). Additionally, potential product accumulation toxicity should be considered, as it was not addressed in this report."
