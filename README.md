# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 11 - Biosynthesis of isoamyl acetate by Saccharomyces cerevisiae

## Project summary (<300 words)
Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

## Project overview
This projects is organized in a following way. _[Report.ipynb](Report.ipynb)_cointains core text description of the project covering introduction, problem definition, selection and assesment of excisting GSM, computer-aided cell factory engineering, discussion and conclusion parts with short statements, tables and figures. 
Main code with results is splited between 6 files related to different analyses.
1. _[02 Model and pathway](02_Model_and_pathway.ipynb)_ - MEMOTE comparison for 7 potential S. cerevisiae models.
2. _[03 Theoretical yields and media optimization](03_Theoretical_yields_and_media_optimization.ipynb)_ - Yields and media optimization analysis.
3. _[04 Phenotype phase plane](04_Phenotype_phase_plane.ipynb)_ - Phenotypic phase plane analysis on the baseline growth and progesterone production for identification cell response to changes in conditions.
4. _[05 Gene target analysis](05_Gene_target_analysis.ipynb)_ - FSEOF analysis of the model with identification of targets for doqnregulation and upregulation.
5. _[06 Co-factor swap](06_Co-factor_swap.ipynb)_ - Co-factor-swapping optimization analysis.
6. _[07 Dynamic FBA](07_Dynamic_FBA.ipynb)_ - Dynamic flux analysis to identify cell response to different environmental conditions or genetic modifications.

In the folder _[Files](Files)_ reaction with manually changed co-factors can be found. Folder _[Models](Models)_ contains yeast models we used for memote analysis. We put figures that are used in the _[Report.ipynb](Report.ipynb)_ to the folder _[Pictures](Pictures)_.
