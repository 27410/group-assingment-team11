    "NAD+ / NADH: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is reduced to NADH in the conversion of isoamyl aldehyde to isoamyl alcohol. This is an oxidation-reduction reaction where NAD+ acts as an oxidizing agent.\n",

    "CoASH / Acetyl-CoA: Coenzyme A (CoASH) is used in the formation of acetyl-CoA, which is a substrate for the reaction that synthesizes isoamyl acetate. Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule in metabolic processes and is formed from acetate and CoASH with the input of energy from ATP.\n",
    "\n",
    "ATP / AMP + PPi: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is converted to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in the reaction that activates acetate to acetyl adenylate as a precursor to acetyl-CoA formation.\n",
